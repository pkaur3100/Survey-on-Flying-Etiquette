# Survey-on-Flying-Etiquette

**This is a chart based on the focus question: How many times a non-aisle passenger in an airplane should be allowed to get up during a 6 -hour flight?**

I picked this question because we have most likeley felt bad or embrassed to have someone in the aisle seat get up for us during a flight and I wanted to reserach how many people actually mind andhow many times during a flight is it acceptable. 

### Point of Interests  

This dataset was not too surprising and the answers seemed fair ecpect for the category of "no times". 13 people voted for it not being okay to get up even once during a 6phour flight and it was shocking as it pushed the limits. There are emergencies that e run into so we need to accomodate for them. 

### Dataset Analysis

The dataset showed that most people thought that it was okay to get up around 3 times during a 6-hour flight, while very few had the expectations of passengers not getting up even once.
